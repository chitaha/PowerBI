# Human trafficking Kenya 2017

The Government of Kenya does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking. 
In 2008 it was reported that Kenya's anti-trafficking efforts improved markedly over the reporting period, 
particularly through greater investigations of suspected trafficking cases. U.S. State Department's Office to 
Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in "Tier 2" in 2017.
Their efforts remain uncoordinated and lack strong oversight, creating an environment conducive to trafficking.

The data story has been based on:
* Coping Mecahnisms of Human trafficking victims
* Challenges faced in preventing human trafficking
* External destinations of human trafficking victims
* Factors contributing to human trafficking
* Genders of external victims of human trafficking
* Methods of recruitment
* Purpose of human trafficking
